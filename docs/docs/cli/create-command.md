# Create command

The `create` command helps you in writing your flow tests. It will go step by step through the 
actions you want to perform and then generates a flow test file for you.

## Usage

```shell
# Create the given flow, will ask for description and the steps to execute.
fluttium create your_flow.yaml

# Create the given flow, will ask for the steps to execute.
fluttium create your_flow.yaml --desc "My first flow"
```
